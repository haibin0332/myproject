download git
git-scm.com/downloads (Git Bash)


Git Bash (same to linux)

1)set up git

$git config --global user.name "haibin0332(e.g.)" 

$git config --global user.email "email address(e.g.)"


$cd Desktop (the route to copy and download the files)

$ls 

$clear

2) create repositories
https://github.com/haibin0332 (create repositories)

get clone the repository (clone uses for copy and download the link)

$git clone (https://github.com/haibin0332/myproject.git)(right side->edit->paste) 

$cd myproject (coming into Desktop/myproject)

$ls (README.md)
$vim README.md (or open with notepad++/)

import comments:

$git status

tell the changes of the files

then, after we know the changes, we can use the following comments

$git add README.md (not on the website yet, this is the intermediate step between local and pushing online)


$git commit (get ready step finilizing to push on the repository not exactlly real pushing)
($git commit -help)
($git commit -m (this commit a message on your changes) e.g. $git commit -m "updated readme file")

$git log
record what happen

$git status
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master'by 1 commit

If you do not have remote origin (current location) (necessary step if you without clone)
$git remote add origin (https://github.com/haibin0332/myproject.git)
fatal:remote origin already exists.

###########################################
the most important step

$git push -u origin master


username/password

add---commit---push

e.g. 

$touch (test.txt) create a new file (changes in local files)

$ls

add---commit---push


$git add file
$git add . (the whole files)
"git add -A" stages all   (add new files, modified files, deleted files)

"git add ."  stages new and modified, without deleted (add new files, modified and deleted files)

"git add -u"  stages modified and deleted, without new (add modified files and deleted files)

"git add --ignore-removal" (add new files and modified files) 


$git commit (-m "explanations")


$git push
